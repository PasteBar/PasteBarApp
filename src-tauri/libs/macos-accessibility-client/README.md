# macOS accessibility client

This crate, in its current state, only provides the functionality to query whether the running application is a trusted accessibility client, and if not, display the following rather well known prompt:

More functionality may be added in the future. Feel free to open an issue if you think there's something missing.

How to use:

```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
fn query_accessibility_permissions() -> bool {
    let trusted = macos_accessibility_client::accessibility::application_is_trusted_with_prompt();
    if trusted {
        print!("Application is totally trusted!");
    } else {
        print!("Application isn't trusted :(");
    }
    return trusted
}

#[cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))]
fn query_accessibility_permissions() -> bool {
    print!("Who knows... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è");
    return true
}
```
